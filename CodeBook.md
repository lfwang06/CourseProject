### Work to clean up the data

Here are [the raw data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

To obtain the final tidy data, the following work was performed:

* Read the train, train labels, train subjuct data into R, and combine them into one data set named ctrain.

* Read the test, test labels, test subjuct data into R, and combine them into one data set named ctest.

* Merged data set ctrain and data set ctest to one data set called alldata.

* Read the feature data into R and used it to replace the names of variables of alldata.

* subset alldata based on the variables which contains mean() or std() to form a smaller data set named mydata .

* Read the activity data into R and used it to name the value of activities in the data set mydata.

* Edited the variables of mydata by getting rid off all "-" and "()".

* Checked for missing values.

* Computed the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* Wrote the tidydata to a text file.
